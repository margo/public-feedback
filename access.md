# GitHub Access Management Policy

## Teams, not Individuals

Access to private repositories will be granted only to Margo Organisations, not to individuals. A repo may have any number of teams added to it, with the appropriate access levels.

## Team Structure
Teams will be nested, using parent/child relationships, as needed. A child team will implicitly have any privileges its parent team does, so the most deeply nested team should be the one with the most privileges.

## Principle of Least Privilege

 Permission levels should be set as high as necessary, but no higher.

- There are a few settings that justify Admin access over Maintain, so prefer Maintain.
- Explicit Read access has an advantage: users with Read access can be assigned to issues and requested as PR reviewers even if they're not the author.

- added changes for PR
