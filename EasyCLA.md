## What are CLAs?
Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) are legal documents that define the terms under which individuals or organizations contribute code or other intellectual property to an open-source project. 

##  Why use EasyCLA?
Open-source projects often require contributors to sign a CLA before their contributions can be accepted. EasyCLA automates this process, making it easier for maintainers to manage contributions and for contributors to get authorized. 

## Key features of EasyCLA:
- Supports both individual and corporate CLAs: EasyCLA handles both situations where individuals are contributing on their own behalf (ICLA) and when companies are contributing through their employees (CCLA). 
- Automated workflows: EasyCLA automates the signing process, authorization, and tracking of CLAs, reducing manual effort for project maintainers. 
- Improved visibility: Project directors and managers can see which CLAs have been signed and who is authorized to contribute, providing better oversight. 
- Integration with popular platforms: EasyCLA integrates with GitHub and Gerrit, with GitLab and other systems on the roadmap. 

## How it works:
1. When a contributor attempts to submit a contribution to a project using EasyCLA, they will be prompted to sign a CLA if they haven't already. 
2. If it's an individual contribution, they can sign an Individual CLA (ICLA). 
3. If it's a corporate contribution, they can identify their company and either be authorized under an existing Corporate CLA (CCLA) or initiate the process to sign a new one. 
4. The CLA manager for the company can then manage authorized contributors through the EasyCLA Corporate Console. 

## Benefits for projects:
- Reduces administrative overhead: Automates the CLA process, freeing up maintainers' time. 
- Protects project IP: Ensures that contributions are made under the project's legal terms. 
- Streamlines the contribution process: Makes it easier for contributors to get authorized and start contributing. 

## Benefits for contributors:
- Simplifies the contribution process: Reduces the friction involved in getting authorized to contribute. 
- Provides clarity and transparency: Makes it clear what is required for contribution. 
- Reduces delays in getting contributions accepted . 

In essence, EasyCLA is a crucial tool for open-source projects that helps them manage the legal aspects of contributions in a streamlined and efficient way, ultimately fostering a healthy and sustainable open-source ecosystem.
