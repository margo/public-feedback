### Summary
Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) are facilitated by LFX EasyCLA, ensuring a smooth and efficient contribution process for all parties involved.

## What is a CLA?
Some projects use a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to define the terms under which content (such as source code or documentation) is contributed to the project.

Not all projects use CLAs; many use alternative contribution mechanisms, such as the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) sign-off process. However, for projects that utilize CLAs, tools like LFX EasyCLA help ensure that contributions are only merged into the project if the contributors have signed a valid CLA.

### Types of CLAs
There are two main types of CLAs:

1. Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)
- Used when a contribution is made on behalf of a company, typically by an employee.
- The individual signing the CCLA must have the authority to bind the company legally, which is often not the case for the contributors themselves.
- After signing a CCLA, the CLA Manager uses the EasyCLA Corporate Console to manage the list of authorized contributors.

2. Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)
- Required for contributors who own their work.
- Before their contributions can be merged into the project repository, contributors must sign an ICLA.

Once a contributor has been authorized under a signed CLA, they can proceed to contribute to the project without facing any restrictions imposed by the EasyCLA checks.
